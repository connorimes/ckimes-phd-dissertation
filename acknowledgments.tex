There are so many people to thank, I cannot hope to list them all here.

My family...
Your unwavering support, both before and during graduate school, made my endeavors possible.
Through the ten years and living in five different states since college, time and distance have only heightened my appreciation for everything you have given me.
Thank you.
% Thanks also for an ample supply of fish.

Those who aided my journey getting here...
Professor Michael Crowley at the University of Southern California, for a letter of recommendation five years after I graduated.
My coworkers from Lockheed Martin, especially Gerald Nostrand for also writing a letter of recommendation. %, and for just being an awesome technical manager---thanks for letting us be engineers.

My advisor, Professor Hank Hoffmann...
Thanks for the exceptional mentoring and support, and for sending me \emph{everywhere}, especially Portugal, Hong Kong, Greece, and France.
I wish you could have joined in the global adventures, but thanks also for trusting me to ``spread the gospel'' and defend our work on my own.
Now that you have tenure, my work here is done!

Others at the University of Chicago...
Professors Andrew Chien and Haryadi Gunawi, for being on my Master's committee.

Those who supported my research outside the university...

Steve Hofmeyr, for research collaboration, hosting me at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and being on my dissertation committee.

Rhys Povey (Physics), for organizing so many social events, barbecues, and our intramural volleyball team.
Neville Eclov (Medical Physics), for having us on the Ionizers softball team and hosting classy parties in the off-season.
Will Kong, Joe Wingerter, Kavon Farvardin, and Saeid Barati (again), for all the home brewing and other social activities.

G{\"o}kalp Demirci, for casual drinks, and being the only one to show up for my first-year Thanksgiving potluck.
Anne Farrell, for cookies, a bicycle, and impressively silent socialization.
All the PSD Happy Hour regulars from the department, for banter over cheap pizza and beverages.

All members of Hank's group, past and present, especially those not yet mentioned but equally important to me---Zhixuan Zhou, Bernard Dickens, and Muhammad Husni Santriaji...
Thanks for putting up with the sarcastic old guy in the room.
I hope I managed to drop a little wisdom along the way---if you find it, I might need it back.
