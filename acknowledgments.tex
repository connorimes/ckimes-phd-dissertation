None of my efforts in graduate school would have been possible without the unwavering support from my family.
Thanks for an ample supply of fish and plane tickets.

Those who helped me get here in the first place...
Professor Michael Crowley at the University of Southern California, for his letter of recommendation five years after my graduation.
My coworkers at Lockheed Martin, especially Gerald Nostrand for his letter of recommendation, and for just being an awesome technical manager -- thanks for letting us be engineers.

At the University of Chicago... Hank Hoffmann, the best advisor a graduate student could ask for.
Besides the exceptional mentoring and support which would require a whole other thesis to describe, thanks for off-topic conversations, and for taking me into your confidence far more than most advisors ever would.
Thanks also for sending me \emph{everywhere}, especially Portugal, Hong Kong, Greece, and France -- I wish you could have attended as well, but thanks also for trusting me to present and defend our work on my own.
I am so glad to see you get tenure---my work here is done!

For my other collaborators at UChicago...
Nikita Mishra and David Kim, thanks for the co-authorships.
Huazhe (Harper) Zhang and Kevin Zhao, thanks for helping with the grunt work.

For those who supported my research outside the university...
Lars Bergstrom, for the summer position at Mozilla Research.
Steve Hofmeyr, for research collaboration and hosting me at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
Our Proteus project collaborators at Rice, UT Austin, and MIT, especially Don Fussell and Krishna Palem.

Special thanks to Saeid Barati for finding volleyball and softball groups where we can unwind, and sometimes even win games.
For my fellow graduate students, and especially the members of Hank's group not already mentioned (Zhixuan Zhou, Anne Farrell, Will Kong, Bernard Dickens, Ivana Marincic, Muhammad Husni Santriaji)... thanks for dealing with the old guy in the room.
