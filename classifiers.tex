\chapter{CEES: Classification of Energy-efficient Settings}

This chapter describes CEES (\textbf{C}lassification of \textbf{E}nergy-\textbf{e}fficient \textbf{S}ettings), focusing on the High Performance Computing (HPC) domain.
Energy and power consumption will be first-class constraints in future exascale systems \cite{exaosr-power}.
For example, these systems are predicted to have strict operating budgets of approximately 20 MW \cite{Exascale20MW}.
Additionally, exascale operating systems are required to actively ``decrease the cost per scientific insight'' \cite{DOEML}.  
Minimizing application energy, even if runtime is increased, can: (1) greatly reduce the cost (in Joules) of scientific insight, and (2) increase application throughput in over-provisioned, power-constrained systems---such as future exascale computers \cite{PatkiRMAP,Sarood2013}---by allowing more applications to execute on a cluster simultaneously.

We therefore propose to dynamically monitor application and system behavior at runtime and use machine learning classification to predict the most energy-efficient resource settings as the application executes.
% In this context, energy efficiency is the ratio of work completed to energy consumed---effectively, the runtime cost of performing a fixed-size computation.
The proposed approach has two distinct benefits.
First, it can be applied to new applications without modifying either the classifier or application, as it does not require application-level instrumentation or hooks.
Second, classification's low overhead makes it suitable for running in-situ on compute nodes.
