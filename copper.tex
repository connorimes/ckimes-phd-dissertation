\chapter{CoPPer: Control Performance with Power}
\label{sec:copper}

This chapter describes CoPPer (\textbf{Co}ntrol \textbf{P}erf\-ormance with \textbf{P}ow\textbf{er}), a software system that uses adaptive control theory to meet application performance goals by manipulating hardware power caps \cite{CopperTR}.
As software management of DVFS is becoming deprecated, we propose CoPPer as a replacement.
CoPPer has three key features.
First, it works on applications \emph{without prior knowledge} of their specific performance/power tradeoffs; \ie it does not require a system or application-specific power cap/performance model based on pre-characterization, making it suitable for general purpose computing workloads composed of repeated jobs.
Second, it uses a Kalman filter to adapt control to \emph{non-linearities} in the power cap/performance relationship.
Third, it introduces adaptive \emph{gain limits} to prevent power from being over-allocated when applications cannot achieve additional speedup.
That is, if a workload's performance does not improve with expanded power limits, CoPPer will not allocate additional power, whereas standard control-theoretical approaches take no additional power-saving action.
Thus, CoPPer saves energy in many cases compared to existing DVFS-based approaches while maintaining its formal guarantees.
