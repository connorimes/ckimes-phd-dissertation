\section{General and Portable Resource Allocation}
\label{sec:poet-framework}

The goal of POET's resource allocation framework is twofold.
First, it must provide predictable timing so application jobs meet their deadlines.
Second, it should minimize energy consumption given the timing requirement.
While these two subproblems are intrinsically connected, they can be decoupled to provide a general solution.
The complexity arises from the need to keep resource allocation general with respect to the running application and the hardware platform.
We tackle the problem of providing predictable timing using control theory by computing a \emph{generic control signal}.
Using the computed control signal, we then solve the energy minimization problem using mathematical optimization.

\figref{poet-runtime} illustrates our approach.
The \textbf{application} informs the runtime of its job \emph{performance goal}.
Measuring each job start and completion time (\emph{performance feedback}), POET's runtime computes the \emph{performance error} and passes it to the \textbf{controller}.
The controller uses the error to calculate a \emph{generic control signal}, indicating how much the application speed should be altered.
This signal is used by the \textbf{optimizer}, together with the \textbf{resource specification}, to produce a \emph{resource schedule} that achieves the desired performance goal while minimizing energy consumption.
Both the controller and the optimizer are designed independently of any particular application and system.
The only assumption made is that applications are composed of repeated jobs with a soft real-time performance goal.
% As we target multicore platforms, we assume each job may be processed by multiple, communicating threads.

\subsection{Controller}

The application provides a \emph{performance goal} (work rate) $R_{ref}$, which is easily computed from a workload size (number of jobs) $\omega$ and desired latency goal (deadline) $\tau$ for those $\omega$ jobs:
\begin{equation}
  R_{ref} = \frac{\omega}{\tau}
  \label{eqn:poet-latency-to-performance}
\end{equation}
The controller cancels the error between the desired performance, $R_{ref}$, and the measured performance, $r_m(t)$, which it models as:
\begin{equation}
r_m(t) = s(t-1) \cdot b_r(t-1)
\label{eqn:poet-performance}
\end{equation}
The error $e_r(t)$ is then easily computed as:
\begin{equation}
e_r(t) = R_{ref} - r_m(t)
\label{eqn:poet-error}
\end{equation}
The controller performs its calculations at discrete work (job) intervals to produce a new desired speedup, $s(t)$, implementing the \emph{integral control law}~\cite{Hellerstein2004a}:
\begin{equation}
  s(t) = s(t-1) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \frac{e_r(t)}{b_r(t)}
  \label{eqn:poet-control}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a \emph{pole} of the closed loop characteristic equation~\cite{ICSE2014} such that $\alpha$ lies within the unit circle:
\begin{equation}
  0 \le \alpha < 1
  \label{eqn:pole}
\end{equation}
The pole is configurable.
Small $\alpha$ values make the controller highly reactive, while large values make it slow to respond to external changes.
However, a large $\alpha$ ensures robustness with respect to transient fluctuations and may be beneficial for very noisy systems.
A small $\alpha$ will cause the controller to react quickly, potentially producing a noisy control signal.

The parameter $b_r(t)$ represents the application's base speed, which directly influences the controller.
Different applications will have different base speeds.
Applications may also experience \emph{phases}, where base speed changes over time.
To accommodate these situations, POET continually estimates base speed using a Kalman filter~\cite{welch2006kalman}, which adapts $b_r(t)$ of \eqnref{poet-control} to the current application behavior.
Assuming minimal measurement variance (\ie even if an application is noisy, the signaling framework does not add additional noise) and denoting the application timing variance as $q_b(t)$, the Kalman filter formulation is standard:
\begin{equation}
\left \lbrace
\begin{array}{rcl}
\hat{b}^{-}(t) & = & \hat{b}(t-1) \\
e^{-}_{b}(t) & = & e_{b}(t-1) + q_b(t) \\
k_b(t) 
  & = & \frac{e^{-}_{b}(t) \cdot s(t)}{[s(t)]^2
        \cdot e^{-}_{b}(t)} \\
\hat{b}(t) 
  & = & \hat{b}^{-}(t) + k_b(t) 
        \, \left[ r_m(t) - s(t) \cdot \hat{b}^{-}(t) \right] \\
e_{b}(t) & = & [1 - k_b(t) \cdot s(t-1)] \, e^{-}_{b}(t)
\end{array}
\right .
\label{eqn:kalman-filter}
\end{equation}
This formulates Kalman gain for job latency as $k_b(t)$, the \emph{a priori} and \emph{a posteriori} estimates of the base speed as $\hat{b}^{-}(t)$ and $\hat{b}(t)$, and the \emph{a priori} and \emph{a posteriori} estimates of the error variance as $e^{-}_{b}(t)$ and $e_{b}(t)$.
The Kalman filter produces a statistically optimal estimate of the system's parameters and is provably exponentially convergent~\cite{CaoSchwartz2003}.

Unlike prior work, the POET controller does not reason about a particular set of resources, but computes a generic control signal $s(t)$.
The advantage of using the Kalman filter is that POET's formulation is independent of particular applications and systems.
POET provides formal guarantees about its steady-state convergence and robustness without requiring users to understand control theory or Kalman filtering---$s(t)$ is computed by the controller, $r_m(t)$ and $q_b(t)$ are measured, and all other parameters are derived.


\subsection{Optimizer}
\label{sec:poet-optimizer}

The optimizer turns the generic control signal computed by the controller into a system-specific resource allocation strategy, translating the speedup $s(t)$ computed with \eqnref{poet-control} into a \emph{schedule} for the available resources.
The \emph{schedule} is computed for the next $\omega$ work units (jobs).

As shown in \figref{poet-runtime}, the optimizer takes, as input, a resource specification containing the set of available system configurations.
There are $C$ possible configurations in the system and by convention, we number the configurations from $0$ to $C-1$.
We use $c = 0$ to indicate the configuration where the least amount of resources is given to the application. %, corresponding to a low-power idle state or sleep state when available.
In contrast, configuration $C-1$ maximizes the resource availability.
Each configuration $c$ is associated with performance and power values, speedup $s_c$ and powerup $p_c$ respectively, which are normalized to $c = 0$.

Given this information, POET solves the following optimization problem:
\begin{eqnarray}
\minimize && \sum_{c=0}^{C-1} \tau_c \cdot p_c \label{eqn:poet-power} \\
\st %&& \nonumber\\
&& \sum_{c=0}^{C-1} \tau_c \cdot s_c \cdot b_r(t) =  \omega \label{eqn:poet-work} \\
&& \sum_{c=0}^{C-1} \tau_c =  \tau \label{eqn:poet-deadline} \\
&& 0 \le \tau_c \le \tau, \qquad \forall c \in \{0,\ldots,C-1\} \label{eqn:poet-time}
\end{eqnarray}
\eqnref{poet-power} minimizes the total energy consumption.
\eqnref{poet-work} constrains all jobs to complete in the next control period.
\eqnref{poet-deadline} ensures that the time is fully scheduled and \eqnref{poet-time} imposes that a non-negative time is assigned to each configuration.
Solving linear optimization problems is, in general, hard, but this particular problem has a structure that makes it practical to solve.
Feasible solutions are confined to a polytope in the positive quadrant defined by the two constraints \eqnsref{poet-work}{poet-deadline}.
Thus, linear programming theory states an optimal solution exists for this problem when all the $\tau_c$ are equal to zero except for (at most) two configurations~\cite{LP}.

  \label{algo:poet-optimal}
\end{algorithm}

\algoref{poet-optimal} takes the set of configurations $C$, the controller's speedup $s(t)$, and the number of work units $\omega$ in a control period.
It then divides the configurations in two distinct subsets.
The first subset contains all configurations with a speedup less than or equal to the target.
The second contains the remaining configurations, \ie those with speedups greater than required.
Subsequently, \algoref{poet-optimal} loops over all feasible pairs of configurations, with one from each subset, to determine how much time should be spent in each configuration given speedup constraint.
If the energy of the pair is lower than any previous energy, the algorithm stores the current best pair, its energy, and its schedule.
When the algorithm terminates, its output is the pair of chosen configurations and their assigned times.
The algorithm tests all possible pairs from the two subsets, each of which contains at most $C$ elements, so an upper bound to the algorithm complexity is $O(C^2)$.
We know that there is an optimal solution to the linear program with at most two non-zero $\tau_c$ (as the dual problem has two dimensions \cite{LP}).
Therefore, \algoref{poet-optimal} will find a minimal-energy schedule.


\subsection{Generality and Robustness}

The controller and the optimizer both reason about speedup instead of absolute performance or latency.
The absolute performance of the application, measured by the average latency of its jobs, will vary as a function of the application itself and the platform it executes on.
However, speedup is a general concept and can be applied to any application and system, providing a more general metric for control.
Moreover, the controller customizes the behavior of a specific application using the estimate of its base speed produced by the Kalman filter
The optimizer operates in a platform-independent manner, using the available configurations provided as input to find the optimal solution, without relying on a particular heuristic that may be system-specific or application-dependent.
Finally, the customizable pole $\alpha$ in \eqnref{poet-control} allows for flexibility and robustness to inaccuracies and noise.

The ability to control robustness to inaccuracies and model errors is a major advantage of feedback control systems~\cite{ICSE2014}.
In particular, POET is stable and converges to the desired latency without oscillations provided that $0 \le \alpha < 1$.
Formal analysis of this behavior can be obtained by applying standard control techniques---see the original POET publication for further details \cite{POET}.

In addition to provable convergence, the control formulation allows us to analyze POET's robustness to user error.
In particular, suppose $\Delta$ is a multiplicative error term, indicating the largest error in the speedup values provided in the system configurations.
That is, if the provided speedup is $s_p$, the real value is $s_p \cdot \Delta$.
POET cancels the error despite inaccurate information if and only if $0 < \Delta < \frac{2}{1-\alpha}$.
The value of $\alpha$ therefore determines how robust POET is to errors in speedup specifications.
For example, when $\alpha = 0.1$, $s_p$ can be off by a factor of $2$ and the system is still guaranteed to converge.
Users who can provide good system models will therefore use a small $\alpha$, while less confident users can select a larger $\alpha$.
All the experiments in our evaluation use $\alpha=0$ to test our implementation in the least forgiving setting.
A detailed analysis of POET's robustness is presented in the original POET publication \cite{POET}.
