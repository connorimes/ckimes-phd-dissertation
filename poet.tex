\chapter{POET: The Performance with Optimal Energy Toolkit}
\label{sec:poet}

This chapter describes POET (the \textbf{P}erformance with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{E}nergy \textbf{T}oolkit).
\secref{related} discussed existing work in managing performance and power/energy awareness.
Like POET, a number of these approaches use feedback control to manage timing constraints \cite{Agilos,Bertini2007,grace2,CoAdapt,Maggio13,TCST,ControlWare,PTRADE,Fu2012,Li2007}.
POET is most related to prior approaches that abstract resource management into a middleware or runtime, like \cite{ControlWare,Sojka,PTRADE,Rajkumar}.
Control techniques provide a formal framework for reasoning about the dynamic behavior of the system.
POET is unique in its energy awareness, in its design for portability, and the incorporation of a true minimal-energy resource allocation algorithm.
