\chapter{POET: The Performance with Optimal Energy Toolkit}
\label{sec:poet}

This chapter describes POET (the \textbf{P}erformance with \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{E}nergy \textbf{T}oolkit).
\secref{related} discussed existing work in managing performance and power/energy awareness.
Like POET, a number of these approaches use feedback control to manage timing constraints \cite{Bertini2007,Fu2012,PTRADE,CoAdapt,Agilos,Li2007,TCST,Maggio13,grace2,ControlWare}.
POET is most related to prior approaches that abstract resource management into a middleware or runtime \cite{PTRADE,Rajkumar,Sojka,ControlWare}.
POET uses control techniques, which provide a formal framework for reasoning about the dynamic behavior of systems.
POET is unique in its design for portability, its energy awareness, and the incorporation of a true minimal-energy resource allocation algorithm.
