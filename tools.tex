\chapter{Building Tools}
\label{app:tools}

Tool building is often under-appreciated by the computer science research community, yet is crucial to enabling practical systems research.
The projects in this dissertation led to the development of a handful of portable tools that we make available to the community at large.
Link to the published code is available in \appref{urls}.

In \secref{intro}, we described the \emph{observe}, \emph{decide}, and \emph{act} framework that Hoffmann proposed in his ``self-aware'' computing model \cite{HoffmannPhD}.
While core material in this thesis focuses on the \emph{decide} phase, the tools described here are relevant to the \emph{observe} and \emph{act} phases.


\section{Profiling}

Heartbeats 2.0, heartbeats-simple, abstractions, language bindings...

\section{Capturing Power/Energy Data}

POET (and the work that motivated it \cite{Imes2014}) ultimately led to developing EnergyMon, a portable software interface for accessing energy metrics at runtime \cite{energymon}.
EnergyMon was integrated with Mozilla's Servo web browsing engine \cite{servo}.
It is also utilized in other research projects, like the ongoing development of the FAST language, and in the CoPPer project described in this thesis.

RAPLCap, powercap bindings, etc...
